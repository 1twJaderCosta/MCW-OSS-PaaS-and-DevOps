## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They have a MERN stack web application which they host on-premises, and are looking to migrate their OSS application into Azure. They will be creating a custom Docker image for their application, and using a Jenkins and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the application into a Web App for Containers instance. In addition, they will be setting up Azure Cosmos DB, and using the MongoDB APIs, so they don't have to make application code changes to leverage the power of Cosmos DB.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will create a custom Docker image, provision an Azure Container Registry, push the image to the registry, and configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance. You will also help them implement functionality enhancements using serverless architecture.

## Solution Architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points in a linear fashion to GitHub Repo, Jenkins, and the VSTS icons. The previous three icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. VSTS points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Container to: Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions).](images/Hands-onlabunguided-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor, so they can leverage its rich integration with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process using Release Management in VSTS.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture will be applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions will be used to automate the processing of orders. Logic Apps will be applied to send SMS notifications, via a Twilio connector, to customers informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.

The function checks the processed field on the order document, ensuring only unprocessed orders are sent to the processing queue.

### Task 1: Provision a Function App

In this task, you will create a Function App in Azure, which will host your Functions.

#### Task to complete

-   Create a Function App in the Azure portal

*Exit criteria*

-   You can navigate to your Function App in the Azure portal

### Task 2: Configure storage queues

In this task, you will add two storage queues to the storage account provisioned when you created your Function App. These queues will be used to store orders and notifications needing to be processed.

#### Task to complete

-   Create storage queues in the storage account associated with your Function App

    -   orderqueue

    -   notificationqueue

*Exit criteria*

-   You created the two queues

### Task 3: Create Cosmos DB trigger function

In this task, you will create a function that will be triggered whenever a document is inserted into the orders collection in your Azure Cosmos DB. This function sends all new orders to a queue for processing and shipping. This function will use a Cosmos DB trigger and an output binding to an Azure Storage Queue.

#### Task to complete

-   Create a Cosmos DB trigger function, named OrdersCosmosTrigger

    -   Connect to your Cosmos DB account

    -   Collection name: orders (case sensitive)

    -   Rename the Document collection parameter to newOrders

    -   Add an Azure Storage Queues output

        -   Name: outputQueue

        -   Queue name: orderqueue (case sensitive)

    -   Get the code for the OrdersCosmosTrigger function from the OrdersCosmosTrigger.js in the AzureFunctions folder in VS Code

-   Sign into the app, and place an order

    -   Email address: <demouser@bfyo.com>

    -   Password: Password.1!!

-   Update on order directly in Cosmos DB, setting the processed field to true

*Exit criteria*

-   You can see items processing through the OrdersCosmosTrigger function logs

    ![Two items are highlighted in the OrdersCosmosTrigger function logs.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image27.png "View items processing through the function logs")

    ![Refresh is highlighted on the Messages blade, and two items are displayed under Message Text.](images/Hands-onlabunguided-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image28.png "Verify that items are being written to the order queue")

### Task 4: Create Queue function

In this task, you will create a second function which will be triggered the output of the OrdersCosmosTrigger function. This will simulate the order processing, and will add items to the notificationqueue, if the order processing is complete, and sendNotifications is true for the order.

This will use an Azure Storage Queue trigger, and an input dataset from Cosmos DB, pulling in customers. Output dataset will be Azure Cosmos DB orders table, and an update to set processed = true, and the processedDate to today.

#### Task to complete

-   Add a Queue trigger Function, using the output from the OrdersCosmosTrigger as its trigger

    -   Name: ProcessOrders

    -   Queue name: orderqueue (case sensitive)

    -   Rename the Message parameter name to orderToProcess

    -   Add an Azure Cosmos DB input, connected to the users collection in your Cosmos DB

    -   Add an Azure Queue Storage output

        -   Message parameter name: outputQueue

        -   Queue name: notificationqueue (case sensitive)

    -   Get the code for the ProcessOrders function from VS Code, in the AzureFunctions folder, select ProcessOrders.js

-   Register a new account in the app, and use a cell phone number where you can receive text message in the phone field

-   Sign in and place an order

*Exit criteria*
