# Abstract

## Workshop

This workshop is designed to help students gain a better understanding of how to integrate and deploy complex Open Source Software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. Attendees will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure PaaS services, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

Attendees will learn how to:

-   Provision Web App for Containers for hosting OSS applications

-   Migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB

-   Implement serverless technologies, such as Logic Apps and Azure Functions, to enhance OSS app functionality

-   Provision an Azure Container Registry

-   Build Docker images and push them into the Azure Container Registry

-   Enable continuous deployment with Jenkins and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)
