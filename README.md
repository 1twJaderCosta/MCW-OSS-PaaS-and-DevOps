## Abstract

### Workshop

This workshop is designed to help students gain a better understanding of how to integrate and deploy complex Open Source Software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. Attendees will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure PaaS services, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

Attendees will learn how to:

- Provision Web App for Containers for hosting OSS applications
- Migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB
- Implement serverless technologies, such as Logic Apps and Azure Functions, to enhance OSS app functionality
- Provision an Azure Container Registry
- Build Docker images and push them into the Azure Container Registry
- Enable continuous deployment with Jenkins and the [Azure App Service Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-app-service)
