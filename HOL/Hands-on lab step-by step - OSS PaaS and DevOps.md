# OSS PaaS and DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This workshop is designed to help students gain a better understanding of how to integrate and deploy complex Open Source Software (OSS) workloads into Azure PaaS. Attendees will migrate an existing MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application from a hosted environment into Azure PaaS services, and fully embrace modern DevOps tools.

Attendees will learn how to:

-   Provision Web App for Containers for hosting OSS applications

-   Migrate a MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB

-   Implement serverless technologies, such as Logic Apps and Azure Functions, to enhance OSS app functionality

-   Provision an Azure Container Registry

-   Build Docker images and push them into the Azure Container Registry

-   Enable continuous deployment with Jenkins and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS)

## Overview

Best For You Organics Company is one of the leading health food suppliers in North America, serving customers in Canada, Mexico, and the United States. They have a MERN stack web application which they host on-premises and are looking to migrate their OSS application into Azure. They will be creating a custom Docker image for their application and using a Jenkins and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline to deploy the application into a Web App for Containers instance. In addition, they will be setting up Azure Cosmos DB, and using the MongoDB APIs, so they do not have to make application code changes to leverage the power of Cosmos DB.

In this hands-on lab, you will assist with completing the OSS application and database migrations into Azure. You will create a custom Docker image, provision an Azure Container Registry, push the image to the registry, and configure the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application to a Web App for Containers instance. You will also help them implement functionality enhancements using serverless architecture.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This diagram consists of icons that are connected by arrows. On the left, the Developer icon (VS Code) points in a linear fashion to GitHub Repo, Jenkins, and the VSTS icons. The previous three icons are enclosed in a box labeled CI/CD Pipeline. VSTS points to Web App for Containers on the right. Various arrows point from Web App for Container to: Azure Container Registry (a double-sided arrow); Logic Apps (a linear arrow that also points from Logic Apps to Customers); Customers (a linear arrow); and Azure Cosmos DB (a double-sided arrow that also points from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Functions with another double-sided arrow).](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image2.png "Solution architecture diagram")

The solution begins with developers using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as their code editor, so they can leverage its rich integration with GitHub, Docker, and Azure. From a high level, developers will package the entire OSS application inside a custom Docker container using the Docker extension in VS Code. The image will be pushed to an Azure Container Registry as part of a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub, Jenkins, and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). This Docker image will then be deployed to a Web App for Containers instance, as part of their continuous delivery process using Release Management in VSTS.

The MongoDB database will be imported into Azure Cosmos DB, using mongoimport.exe, and access the database from the application will continue to use the MongoDB APIs. The database connection string in the application will be updated to point to the new Cosmos DB.

Serverless architecture will be applied to order processing and customer notifications. Azure Functions will be used to automate the processing of orders. Logic Apps will be applied to send SMS notifications, via a Twilio connector, to customers informing them that their order has been processed and shipped.

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    -   Trial subscriptions will *not* work

2.  Linux virtual machine configured with:

    -   Visual Studio Code

    -   Azure CLI

    ```

    ![The above command to seed the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image42.png "Bash terminal window")

5.  Next, build the application using the following:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```

6.  Finally, enter the following to launch the application.
    ```
    npm start
    ```

7.  Open a browser and navigate to <http://localhost:3000> to view the landing page of the starter application. You will see three plans listed on the application home page, which are pulled from the local MongoDB database.
    
    ![Two Person Plan, Four Person Plan, and High-Pro Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the application home page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image43.png "View the three plans")

8.  Return to the VS Code integrated terminal window, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to Cosmos DB

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will provision an Azure Cosmos DB account, and then update the starter application's database connection string to point to your new Azure Cosmos DB account. You will then, use *mongoimport.exe* to migrate the data in your MongoDB database into Cosmos DB collections, and verify with the application that you are connected to your Cosmos DB database.

### Task 1: Provision Cosmos DB using the MongoDB API

In this task, you will provision a new Azure Cosmos DB account using the MongoDB API.

1.  In the Azure portal, select **+Create a resource**, **Databases**, the select **Azure Cosmos DB**. 
    
    ![+ Create a resource is highlighted in the navigation pane of the Azure portal, and Databases and Azure Cosmos DB are highlighted on the New blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image44.png "Azure Portal")

2.  On the **Azure Cosmos** **DB** blade, enter the following:

    -   **ID**: Enter "best-for-you-db-SUFFIX," where SUFFIX is your Microsoft alias, initials, or another value to ensure the name is unique (indicated by a green check mark).

    -   **API:** Select **MongoDB**.

    -   **Subscription:** Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    -   **Resource Group:** Select **Use existing** and choose the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group** you created previously.

    -   **Location:** Select a location near you from the list (Note: not all locations are available for Cosmos DB)

    -   **Enable geo-redundancy:** Unchecked

    -   Select **Create** to provision the new Azure Cosmos DB account 
    
    ![The information above is entered in the Azure Cosmos DB blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image45.png "Azure Cosmos DB")

### Task 2: Update database connection string

In this task, you will retrieve the connection string for your Azure Cosmos DB database and update the starter application's database connection string.

1.  When your Cosmos DB account is provisioned, navigate to it in the Azure portal.

2.  On the **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade, select **Connection String** under **SETTINGS** in the left-hand menu, and copy the **PRIMARY connection string**.
    
    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade, and the Primary Connection String value is highlighted on the Read-write Keys tab on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image46.png "Azure cosmos DB account blade")

3.  Return to VS Code.

    ```

11. Return to your browser and refresh the application page. Note: You may need to press **CTRL+F5** in your browser window to clear the browser cache while refreshing the page.

    ![This is a screenshot of the refreshed application page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image51.png "Refreshed application screenshot")

12. Notice the three plans that were displayed on the page previously are no longer there. This is because the application is now pointed to your Azure Cosmos DB, and there is no plan data in that database yet.

13. Let's move on to copying the data from the local MongoDB instance into Cosmos DB.

### Task 3: Pre-create and scale collections

In this task, you will create the collections needed for your database migration and increase each collections' throughput from the default 1,000 RUs to 2,500 RUs. This is done to avoid throttling during the migration, and reduce the time required to import data.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account, select **Browse** from the left-hand menu, under **COLLECTIONS**, and select **+Add Collection**.
    
    ![Browse is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu of your Azure Cosmos DB account, and + Add Collection is highlighted on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image52.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

2.  In the **Add Collection** dialog, enter the following:

    -   **Database id:** Select **Create new**, and enter "best-for-you-organics."

    -   **Collection Id:** Enter "orders."

    -   **Storage capacity:** Select **Fixed (10 GB)**.

    -   **Throughput:** Enter "2500."

    -   Select **OK** to create the collection. 
        
        ![The information above is entered in the Add Collection dialog box.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image53.png "Add Collection dialog box")

3.  If they do not already exist, repeat steps 1 and 2 to create collections for:

    -   users

    -   plans

4.  If the users and plans collections already exist from your application connecting, edit each collection to increase their throughput using the following steps.

    -   Expand the existing collection and select **Scale & Settings**.

    -   Enter "2500" into the **Throughput** box and select **Save**.
    
    ![The turned delta next to users is highlighted under Collections, Scale & Settings is selected and highlighted below it, and Save is highlighted on the Scale & Settings tab on the right. 2500 is entered in the Throughput box on the Scale & Settings tab.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image54.png "Collections section")

### Task 4: Import data to the API for MongoDB using mongoimport

In this task, you will use **mongoimport.exe** to import data to your Cosmos DB account. There is a shell script located in the *mcw-oss-paas-devops* solution which handles exporting each collection to a JSON file.

1.  Next, you will execute a script file, included in the project files you downloaded, to handle exporting the data out of your MongoDB into .JSON files on the local file system. These files will be used for the import into Cosmos DB.

2.  On your Lab VM, open a new integrated bash prompt in VS Code by selecting the **+** next to the shell dropdown in the integrated terminal pane. 

    ![This is a screenshot of the terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Studio Code dialog box. The + button is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image55.png "Bash terminal window")

3.  At the prompt, enter the following command to grant execute permissions on the export script:
    ```
    chmod +x ~/mcw-oss-paas-devops/data/mongo-export.sh
    ```

4.  Next, run the script by entering the following command:
    ```
    ~/mcw-oss-paas-devops/data/mongo-export.sh
    ```

    ![The above command to export data from the local MongoDB database is displayed in the bash terminal window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image56.png "Bash terminal window")

5.  The script creates the folder \~/MongoExport, and exports each of the collections in your MongoDB to JSON files.

6.  You are now ready to import the data into Azure Cosmos DB using mongoimport.ex*e*.

7.  Use the following command template for executing the data import:
    ```
    mongoimport --host <your_hostname>:10255 -u <your_username> -p <your_password> --db <your_database> --collection <your_collection> --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/<your_collection>.json
    ```

8.  To get the values needed for the template command above, return to the **Connection string** blade for your Azure Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal. Leave this window up, as will need the **HOST, USERNAME**, and **PRIMARY PASSWORD** values from this page to import data to your Cosmos DB account. 
    
    ![Connection String is selected under Settings on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Read-write Keys tab on the right, the values under Host, Username, and Primary Password are highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image57.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

9.  Replace the values as follows in the template command above:

    -   \<your\_hostname\>: Copy and paste the **Host** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade.

    -   \<your\_username\>: Copy and paste the **Username** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection String** blade.

    -   \<your\_password\>: Copy and paste the **Primary Password** value from your **Cosmos DB Connection** **String** blade.

    -   \<your\_database\>: Enter "best-for-you-organics."

    -   \<your\_collection\>: Enter "plans" (Note there are two instances of \<your-collection\> in the template command).

10. Your final command should look something like:
    ```
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection plans --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/plans.json
    ```

11. Copy and paste the final command at the command prompt to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB. 

    ![The final command to import the plans collection into Azure Cosmos DB is displayed in the Command Prompt window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image58.png "Bash terminal window")

12. You will see a message indicating the number of documents imported, which should be 3 for plans.

13. Verify the import by selecting **Data Explorer** in your Cosmos DB account in the Azure portal, expanding plans, and selecting **Documents**. You will see the three documents imported listed.
    
    ![Data Explorer is selected and highlighted on the Azure Cosmos DB account blade. On the Collections blade, the turned delta next to plans is highlighted, and Documents is selected and highlighted below it. On the Mongo Documents tab to the right, the first of three imported documents is selected and highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image59.png "Azure Cosmos DB account blade")

14. Repeat step 8 for the users and orders collections, replacing the **\<your\_collection\>** values with:

    -   users
    ```
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection users --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/users.json
    ```

    -   orders
    ```
    mongoimport --host best-for-you-db.documents.azure.com:10255 -u best-for-you-db -p miZiDmNrn8TnSAufBvTQsghbYPiQOY69hIHgFhSn7Gf10cvbRLXvqxaherSKY6vQTDrvHHqYyICP4OcLncqWew== --db best-for-you-organics --collection orders --ssl --sslAllowInvalidCertificates --type json --file ~/MongoExport/orders.json
    ```

15. To verify the starter application is now pulling properly from Azure Cosmos DB, return to your browser running the starter application (<http://localhost:3000>), and refresh the page. You should now see the three plans appear again on the home page. These were pulled from your Azure Cosmos DB database. 
    
    ![Two Person Plan, High-Pro Plan, and Four Person Plan boxes are visible in this screenshot of the starter application.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image60.png "View the starter application")

16. You have successfully migrated the application and data to use Azure Cosmos DB with MongoDB APIs.

17. Return to the Integrated terminal window of VS Code which is running the application, and press **CTRL+C** to stop the application.

### Task 5: Install Azure Cosmos DB extension for VS Code

In this task, you will install the Azure Cosmos DB extension for VS Code, to take advantage of the integration with Azure Cosmos DB. This extension allows you to view and interact with your Cosmos DB databases, collections, and documents directly from VS Code.

1.  Select the **Extensions** icon, enter "cosmos" into the search box, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** extension, and then select **Install** in the Extension: Azure Cosmos DB window. 
    
    ![The Extensions icon is highlighted on the left side of the Extension: Azure Cosmos DB window.

    ![Choose password for new keyring dialog, with Password.1!! entered in the password and confirm boxes.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image66.png "Choose password window")

9.  Back in VS Code, you should now see your Azure account listed under Azure Cosmos DB, along with your Azure account email listed in the status bar of VS Code.

    ![Your Azure account is listed under Azure Cosmos DB, and your Azure email is listed in the status bar of the Visual Studio Code window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-OSSPaaSandDevOpsimages/media/image67.png "Azure Cosmos DB window")

10. From here, you can view your databases, collections, and documents, as well as edit documents directly in VS Code, and push the updated documents back into your database.

### Task 6: Decrease collection throughput

In this task, you will decrease the throughput on your collections. Azure Cosmos DB uses an hourly billing rate, so reducing the throughput after the data migration will help save costs.

1.  In the Azure portal, navigate to your Azure Cosmos DB account, select **Scale** from the left-hand menu, under **COLLECTIONS.**

2.  Expand the **users** collection and select **Scale & Settings**.

3.  Change the **Throughput** value to "500," and select **Save**.
    
    ![Scale is selected and highlighted on the left side of your Azure Cosmos DB account.
